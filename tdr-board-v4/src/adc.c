 * (will be different for hundreds of tens of thousands of ohms). Works in blocking mode, because there is no need to do it in different way.
 *
 * @note Channels are passed one by one because when you consider the system operation, every sensor have to be set up separately (normally thermistors would be
 * measured simultaneously but because the current mirror is being connected to every one of them separately, it's sequential).
 *
 * Follows standard adc example.
 *
 * The return value is store in the ADC_DataBuffer array and the final value can be obtained outside through get_adc_data_buffer(), which performs a very simple
 * digital filtering (average from the ADC_NUM_SAMPLES number of samples).
